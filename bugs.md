# Bugs & glitches

## Major
* Character/scene ghosts don't work yet. Sometimes they appear in the wrong
	place but more often than not they just don't show up at all.
* data-character-index on dom nodes is erratic, doesn't reflect actual
	characters a lot of the time.
*	character switching is broken (alt)
* Pagination doesn't exist yet
* Backspace & cursor keys are wonky on elements with invisible spaces
* Save & load functionality doesn't exist yet. No way to title scripts

## Minor
* New characters don't register if you paste a chunk of script into the document
* Interface is a bit shit. Needs to be more obvious how you navigate.
